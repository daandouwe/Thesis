## Lisa training lessons
Lessons learned from `disc-job.sh`:
- Training is slow: DiscRNNG takes 9 hours for one epoch on GPU.
- Everything returned NaN :(
- Convergence probably takes only a few epochs (2-4).
- Learning rate and optimizer matter massively.
- Evaluate dev Fscore more frequently.

## Lisa training plans
1. Find what causes NaN.
  - [X] Cause: comes first to mind: custom dropout? 
  - [ ] Build a barrier: only update if grad is NaN.
2. Evaluate dev fscore more than every epoch.
  - [X] Check dev every 10k

## disc-job-2.sh
Run everything again but:
- [X] Lower learning rates
- [X] No momentum in SGD
- [X] Primarily SGD and Adam
- [X] Disable dropout if --dropout 0. (hopefully against NaN)
- [X] check dev every 10k updates.
