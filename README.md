# Thesis

A fresh restart.

## Project description

A stochastic decoder for generative parsing with Recurrent Neural Network Grammars.

The recently proposed Recurrent Neural Network Grammar (RNNG) is a top-down transition-based parser parametrized using Recurrent Neural Networks. There is a discriminative and generative variant. The generative variant can be used for language modeling.

The

## Logbook

I will start using a logbook in this google docs. I will share it with Wilker, and perhaps also with Chris. The logbook will help me plan and evaluate my time. Also, it will give me the structure I desire so badly at this moment.

I will use the logbook for the following things:

* At the beginning of each day I select a small number of things from the to-do list below to work on.
* At the end of each day I will write down what I did, and roughly how much time it took to do it. It will be difficult to keep myself to this! But, it will guide me, make me more focussed, and hopefully motivate me.
* I write down a summary of my meeting with Wilker.
