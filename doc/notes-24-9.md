# Notes
- [ ] Run discrimnative on cluster. Get results.
- [ ] Make generative.

## Latent variables
Vars for interpretation (Disc and Gen)
  - [ ] Discrete concrete
  - [ ] Latent factors for composition function
  - [ ] Cluster based on dimensions of hidden space
  - `technical` Concrete, or Dir prior etc. `done`
Vars for discriminative proposal distribution (Disc and Gen)
  - [ ] More controlled sampling for discriminative model.
  - [ ] Better LM and parsing for generative or also discrimnative.
  - [ ] Modes can capture different analyses
  - `technical` Mixture of Gaussians (up to small K ~ 10)
