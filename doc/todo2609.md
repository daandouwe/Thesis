# Todo list

## Data handling
- [X] Move `get_sent_dict` and `get_sentences` to a more sensible place, like `util.py`

## Training
- [ ] Parallel training: why get nan after some steps?
- [ ] Redesign training into a trainer class. Look into others for inspiration like https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/allennlp/training/trainer.py.
- [X] Redesign folder structure etc. I'm really annoyed with the way it is now.

## Prediction
- [X] Remove parse from model
- [X] Prediction with `GreedyDecoder`.

## Loss functions
- [X] Smoothly integrate ELBO objectives into training (with KL annealing)
- [X] Integrate temperature for discrete training.

## Experiment
- [ ] Run full discriminative (16 sents/sec = 45 mins ==> 10 epochs ~ 5 hours).
- [ ] Run full generative model.

## Latent variables
- [ ] Get latent-factors composition to work.
- [ ] Work on latent-attention.
