# Todo list

## Data handling
- [ ] Move `get_sent_dict` and `get_sentences` to a more sensible place, like `util.py`

## Training
- [ ] Parallel training: why get nan after some steps?
- [ ] Redesign training into a trainer class. Look into others for inspiration like https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/blob/master/allennlp/training/trainer.py.
- [ ] Redesign folder structure etc. I'm really annoyed with the way it is now.

## Experiment
- [ ] Run full discriminative (16 sents/sec = 45 mins) and full generative model.
