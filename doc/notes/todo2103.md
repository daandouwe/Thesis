# Todo
The supervised models are running. They might need to run longer than 5 days.


## Resume training
Write code to resume training.
- [ ] Load model from checkpoint
- [ ] Load all training settings from state.json
- [ ] Can we append to tensorboard writer?
- [ ] Overwrite the model? Or make folder new? I think overwrite (we save the originals separately).


## CSV data from tensorboard
- [X] Write code to convert tensorboard logs to CSV for plots.
- [X] See if we can plot this well (notebook).


## Proposal samples
- [X] See if the code to sample proposals works, use the models trained so far (on lisa!)


## Sample inspection
- [X] Find sentences with large number of samples. Or very uniform. Or low entropy. Or with different modes.


## Sample effect
- [X] Which sequence:
  (a) 1 (both argmax and sample), 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 (or 100)
  (b) 1 (both argmax and sample), 5, 10, 20, 50, 100
  (c) 1, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100
- [X] Number of repetitions? (15, max number)
- [X] Different temperatures:
  (a) 1.0
  (b) 0.8  


## Perplexity computation
See Buys et al. (2018) for this.
- [ ] Joint
- [ ] Argmax joint (?)
- [ ] Argmax conditional (?)
