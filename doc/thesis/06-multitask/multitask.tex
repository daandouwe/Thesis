I doubt whether I should make this a separate chapter.
\begin{itemize}
  \item I just want to describe my cool span-based multitask model, and describe the earlier CCG multitask model.
  \item Maybe I will make it a subsection of the Syntactic evaluation?
  \item Or maybe make it a really short, three page chapter?
\end{itemize}
