In this appendix I will put figures, for cases where there are just too many. For example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The barplots of the syntactic evaluation
  \item The training losses for the various models
  \item The valuation perplexity and f-score during training.
\end{itemize}


\section{Training plots}
We show training plots that are means with standard deviation bands over 10 runs. We have two types of plots: losses and development scores.

\paragraph{Development scores} Plots with development scores.
\begin{itemize}
  \item DiscRNNG + GenRNNG-disc + GenRNNG-crf + CRF (small) development fscores.
  \item CRF parser lossses: our (128d + SGD) and original (250d + Adam).
  \item GenRNNG-disc + GenRNNG-crf development perplexity
  \item Language models: lstm + lstm-ccg + lstm-span development perplexity
  \item GenRNNG + LSTM development perplexity.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Training losses} Plots with training losses.


\section{Test scores}
Here we show violin plots that show the distribution of the test scores.


\section{Samples}
Here we put figures to illustrate the samples.


\section{Syntactic evaluation}
Here we put more bar-charts for the syntactic evaluation.
