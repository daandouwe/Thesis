\section{Data}
I describe in detail the data used in the experiments:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Data preprocessing for the PTB and unlabeled data.
  \item Vocabulary and UNKing for all models.
\end{itemize}

\section{Optimization}
I describe the choices made with regards to optimization.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Optimization by automatic differentiation \citep{Blei+2016:VI}
  \item SGD and not Adam or other adaptive methods \citep{stern2017minimal} and choices of hyperparameters.
  \item Learning rate schedule based on development scores.
  \item Surrogate objective and gradient blocking \cite{schulman2015gradient}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We use Dynet.
  \item Other specifics for optimization such as how to obtain blocked gradients.
\end{itemize}
